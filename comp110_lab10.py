    # dictionary with data. The code should go right below this comment.


    region_name = input("Enter the name of the state you want to graph: ")

    # To Do: Step 2 - Validate that the user-entered region name is a valid one
    # For example, "California" is valid while "Jefferson" is not valid.
    # You should continually re-prompt the user to enter a region name until
    # they enter a valid one. Again, the code should go immediately after this
    # comment.
    # Hint: the "in" operator will be very helpful here.


    # To Do: Step 3 - Use pyplot's pie function to make a pie chart out of the
    # election data for the user-entered region.
    # Each wedge of the pie should be labeled with the candidate's name and
    # should have the "traditional" coloring (red for Republican, blue for
    # Democratic, and black for third-party/other).
    # You should set a label for the pie chart that reads "Election results for
    # California", but modified so that "California" is replaced with whatever
    # region name the user entered.
